# Backend API

Current capability: registration of an unverified student plus configured SMTP verification-code delivery. Code submission/resend endpoints, activation, login, tokens, and marketplace authorization remain future work. The React preview does not call this API.

## POST /auth/register

Accept a JSON object containing exactly `email` and `password`.

- `email`: required string, trimmed and lowercased, syntactically valid, maximum 254 characters, with exactly the ASCII domain `sdu.edu.kz`. Subdomains, suffix lookalikes, Unicode domain aliases/lookalikes, and malformed addresses are rejected. Validation is local and does not make DNS requests.
- `password`: required string of 12–128 characters, with no coercion, trimming, or composition rule. It is stored only as an Argon2id hash.
- Unknown fields, missing fields, wrong types, invalid values, and malformed JSON are rejected before any account is persisted.

HTTP **201** returns only:

```json
{"id": 1, "email": "student@sdu.edu.kz", "verified": false}
```

The persisted account is unverified, unsuspended, and has role student. A six-digit registration code is generated and emailed to the normalized address, with ten-minute validity. Only a keyed, user/purpose-bound digest is stored; no code, refresh session, access token, plaintext password, or password hash is returned. No refresh session is created.

| Status | JSON body | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 201 | id, normalized email, verified=false | Account created |
| 409 | `{"detail":"University email is already registered."}` | Normalized email already exists |
| 422 | `{"detail":"Invalid registration request."}` | Invalid request, no account created |
| 500 | `{"detail":"Registration is temporarily unavailable."}` | Unexpected database failure |
| 503 | `{"detail":"Verification email is temporarily unavailable."}` | Missing SMTP settings or delivery failure; new account/code rolled back |

SMTP delivery uses configured real transport with verified TLS/STARTTLS before authentication, a ten-second network timeout, and connection cleanup. Delivery failures roll back the caller transaction, including new account/code state and replacement invalidation. Duplicate registration does not send another message. Code issuance can be reused internally for replacement and password-reset purpose; no resend or reset endpoint exists yet.

Uniqueness is enforced by PostgreSQL, including concurrent requests; the transaction rolls back on conflict and later requests can still succeed. Responses and application logs do not echo submitted passwords, validation inputs, hashes, URLs, or database credentials. Database exceptions are converted to a generic response rather than driver details. Abuse controls belong to the later security task.

## Application lifecycle

`backend.app.create_app(settings, database=None)` takes validated injected settings and optionally a borrowed Database. Owned infrastructure is disposed on shutdown; borrowed infrastructure remains the caller's responsibility. Importing app/main modules does not load settings or connect. Uvicorn explicitly calls `backend.main:create_runtime_app` with `--factory`; that runtime factory loads configuration and constructs a lazy engine. Apply migrations before registration requests.

OpenAPI is available at `/openapi.json`, with local interactive documentation at `/docs`. See [local setup](local-setup.md) for the tested startup command and the separately confirmed disposable PostgreSQL test contract.

## Verification delivery status

Local verification used actual SMTP protocol/MIME on an isolated loopback fixture, with an explicit test-only plaintext transport substitute. Production certificate verification remains enabled; TLS/auth ordering and failure cleanup were separately tested. No external people were emailed. Provider host/port/sender/credentials remain external operational configuration, and live internet university-inbox delivery has not been verified. See local setup for the credential-dependent operator check.
